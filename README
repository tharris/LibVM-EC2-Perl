This is an interface to Amazon EC2 REST tools that follows the
2013-06-15 API. I created it because I needed access to the Tag and
TagSet interfaces, and neither euca2ools nor Net::Amazon::EC2 provided
this functionality. Almost all of the Amazon API is supported, but API
calls for VM/volume import, bundle task management, and reserved instance
marketplace are not currently implemented.

The module provides an extensible object-oriented interface as
illustrated by the following code:

 # get new EC2 object
 my $ec2 = VM::EC2->new(-access_key => 'access key id',
                        -secret_key => 'aws_secret_key',
                        -endpoint   => 'http://ec2.amazonaws.com');

 # fetch an image by its ID
 my $image = $ec2->describe_images('ami-12345');

 # get some information about the image
 my $architecture = $image->architecture;
 my $description  = $image->description;
 my @devices      = $image->blockDeviceMapping;
 for my $d (@devices) {
    print $d->deviceName,"\n";
    print $d->snapshotId,"\n";
    print $d->volumeSize,"\n";
 }

 # run two instances
 my @instances = $image->run_instances(-key_name      =>'My_key',
                                       -security_group=>'default',
                                       -min_count     =>2,
                                       -instance_type => 't1.micro')
           or die $ec2->error_str;

 # wait for both instances to reach "running" or other terminal state
 $ec2->wait_for_instances(@instances);

 # print out both instance's current state and DNS name
 for my $i (@instances) {
    my $status = $i->current_status;
    my $dns    = $i->dnsName;
    print "$i: [$status] $dns\n";
 }

 # tag both instances with Role "server"
 foreach (@instances) {$_->add_tag(Role=>'server');

 # stop both instances
 foreach (@instances) {$_->stop}

 $ec2->wait_for_instances(@instances); # wait till they stop
 
 # create an image from both instance, tag them, and make them public
 for my $i (@instances) {
     my $img = $i->create_image("Autoimage from $i","Test image");
     $img->add_tags(Name  => "Autoimage from $i",
                    Role  => 'Server',
                    Status=> 'Production');
     $img->make_public(1);
 }

Copying AMIs Between Regions
----------------------------

This library provides a command-line script that makes it easy to move
an EBS-backed Amazon Machine Image (AMI) from one region to another.

  migrate-ebs-image.pl --from us-east-1 --to ap-southeast-1 ami-123456

This script will be installed for you when you install the library.
